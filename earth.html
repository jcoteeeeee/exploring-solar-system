                    Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place known in the universe where life has originated and found
                    habitability. While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid
                    surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet with its ocean, making it an ocean world. The polar regions currently
                    retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes,
                    rivers and atmospheric water. The other 29.2% of the Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands, and
                    is widely covered by vegetation. Below the planet's surface lies the crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic
                    plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Inside the Earth's crust is a liquid
                    outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

                    Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and
                    UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the
                    atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with
                    other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid
                    surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the
                    current average surface temperature of 14.76 Â°C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the
                    amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the
                    polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions,
                    and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.

                    Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar
                    System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the
                    Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. The Earth rotates around its own axis
                    in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). The Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to
                    the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural
                    satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth.
                    Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces the Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis,
                    and gradually slows its rotation.
