                    Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. It is a terrestrial planet with a
                    heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an
                    exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of
                    that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars. Mercury has a dynamic
                    magnetic field with a strength about 1% of that of Earth's and has no natural satellites.

                <p class="info-par">
                    According to current theories, Mercury may have a solid silicate crust and mantle overlying a solid outer core, a deeper
                    liquid core layer, and a solid inner core. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, Mercury has surface temperatures
                    that change wildly during the day, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during
                    sunlight across the equator regions. At Mercury's poles though, there are large reservoirs of water ices that are
                    never exposed to direct sunlight, which has an estimated mass of about 0.025–0.25% the Antarctic ice sheet. There
                    are many competing hypothesis about Mercury's origins and development, some of which incorporate collision with
                    planetesimal and rock vaporization.

                <p class="info-par">
                    Because Mercury is very close to the Sun, the intensity of sunlight on its surface is between 4.59 and 10.61 times the
                    solar constant (amount of the Sun's energy received at 1 astronomical unit, which is roughly the distance between Earth
                    and the Sun). Mercury orbits the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance, meaning that relative to the background stars, it
                    rotates on its axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the Sun. Counterintuitively,
                    due to Mercury's slow rotation, an observer on the planet would see only one Mercurian solar day (176 Earth days) every
                    two Mercurian solar years (88 Earth days each).[4] Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's
                    planets (about 1⁄30 of a degree), and its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets in the Solar
                    System.
