                    Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from the Sun. The reddish color of its surface is due to
                    finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname "the Red Planet".[20][21] There is a sharp
                    contrast between the two Martian hemispheres: the northern hemisphere is on average flatter and smoother than the
                    southern hemisphere. The planet's two poles are covered by water and carbon dioxide ice caps. Surrounding the Martian
                    surface is a dynamic thin atmosphere (1% of Earth's surface pressure), made primarily of carbon dioxide. Mars has two
                    irregularly shaped natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos.

                    Mars has a mean radius of 3,389.5 km (2,106 mi), the second smallest among planets in the Solar System. The gravity on
                    its surface is about 3.72 m/s2 (12.2 ft/s2), which is 38% of Earth's. The temperature on the Martian surface usually
                    ranges from −110 °C (−166 °F) to 35 °C (95 °F). Geologically, Mars is fairly active, with dust devils sweeping the
                    landscape and marsquakes trembling in the ground, a Martian analog to earthquakes. The surface of Mars also hosts the
                    highest mountain (Olympus Mons) and one of the largest canyons in the Solar System (Valles Marineris). Days and seasons
                    on Mars are comparable to those of Earth, with a day length of 24.5 hours, a year length of 1.88 Earth years, and an
                    axial tilt only slightly greater than Earth's.

                    Like the other planets, Mars was formed 4.5 billion years ago. The internal structure of Mars is thought to be composed
                    of an outer crust, a mantle made of silicates, and an inner liquid core. During the Noachian period from about 4.1 to
                    3.7 billion years ago, Mars's surface was marked by meteor impacts, valley formation, erosion, and the possible presence
                    of water oceans. The Hesperian period from 3.7 to 3.2–2 billion years ago was dominated by widespread volcanic activity
                    and flooding that carved immense outflow channels. The Amazonian period, which continues today, was marked by the wind's
                    influence on geological processes. It is not yet known whether life has ever existed on Mars.
