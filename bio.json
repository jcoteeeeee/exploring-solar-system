It is a terrestrial planet with a heavily cratered surface due to the planet having no geological activity and an extremely tenuous atmosphere (called an exosphere). Despite being the smallest planet in the Solar System with a mean diameter of 4,880 km (3,030 mi), 38% of that of Earth's, Mercury is dense enough to have roughly the same surface gravity as Mars."

It is a rocky planet with a mass and size narrowly second in the Solar System to Earth, and with an atmosphere, which is the thickest of all four rocky planets of the Solar System and substantially thicker than Earth's. Its orbit is the next closest to Earth's, orbiting the Sun inferior inside of Earth's orbit, appearing (like Mercury) in Earth's sky always close to the Sun as either a 'morning star' or 'evening star'."

While Earth may not contain the largest volumes of water in the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water, extending over 70.8% of the planet with its ocean, making it an ocean world. The polar regions currently retain most of all other water with large sheets of ice covering ocean and land, dwarfing Earth's groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water."

The reddish color of its surface is due to finely grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, giving it the nickname `the Red Planet`. There is a sharp contrast between the two Martian hemispheres: the northern hemisphere is on average flatter and smoother than the southern hemisphere. The planet's two poles are covered by water and carbon dioxide ice caps."

It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times."

It is the fourth-largest planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere."
