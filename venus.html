                    Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet with a mass and size narrowly second in the Solar System
                    to Earth, and with an atmosphere, which is the thickest of all four rocky planets of the Solar System and substantially
                    thicker than Earth's. Its orbit is the next closest to Earth's, orbiting the Sun inferior inside of Earth's orbit,
                    appearing (like Mercury) in Earth's sky always close to the Sun as either a "morning star" or "evening star". In Earth's
                    sky it is also the natural object with the third highest maximum apparent brightness, after the Sun and the Moon, due to
                    its proximity to Earth and the Sun, its size, and its highly reflective global cloud cover. Because of these
                    prominent appearances in Earth's sky, Venus has been, particularly among the other four star-like classical planets, a
                    common and important object for humans, in their cultures and astronomy.

                <p class="info-par">  
                    Venus retains, despite having only a weak induced magnetosphere, an especially thick atmosphere of mainly carbon
                    dioxide, creating an extreme greenhouse effect together with its global sulfuric acid cloud cover. Because of this, the
                    atmosphere reaches at its bottom a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F) and a crushing pressure of 92 times that
                    of Earth's at sea level, turning the air into a supercritical fluid, though at cloudy altitudes of 50 km (30 mi) Earth
                    like levels are found. Conditions possibly favourable for life on Venus have been identified at its cloud layers, while
                    recent research has found indicative, but not convincing evidence. Early in Venus' history water might have been
                    abundant enough to form oceans, before it probably evaporated when greenhouse effects cascaded and then was taken away
                    into space by the solar wind. Internally Venus is thought to consist of a core, mantle, and crust, the
                    latter releasing internal heat through its active volcanism, shapeing the surface with large resurfacing instead of
                    plate tectonics.

                <p class="info-par">   
                    Venus has no moon (like Mercury).[24] It rotates retrograde (like Uranus), against its orbital direction. Having been
                    slowed by the strong currents and drag of the atmosphere it completes a sidereal rotation, relative to the stars, in 243
                    Earth days. Therefore it rotates slower than it is orbiting, having a solar year of 224.7 Earth days,[25] this results
                    together with the retrograde rotation in having a solar day of 117 Earth days.[26] Venus and Earth approach each other
                    in synodic periods of 1.6 years, while coming closer to each other at inferior conjunction than any other pair of
                    planets, both on average staying closer to Mercury than to any other planet.[27] That said the gravitational potential
                    between Earth and Venus and the needed speed to transfer between them is the lowest than between any other planet from
                    Earth. This and its proximity to Earth has allowed Venus to be the most accessible destination and attractive gravity
                    assist waypoint for interplanetary flights.
