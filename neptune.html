                    Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest
                    planet in the Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the
                    mass of Earth, and slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically smaller than Uranus
                    because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed primarily of gases and
                    liquids, it has no well-defined solid surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance
                    of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
                    has the astronomical symbol â™†, representing Neptune's trident.

                    Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction
                    rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to hypothesise that
                    its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune
                    was predicted from his observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier. Neptune was subsequently
                    observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Le
                    Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 14 known
                    moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small
                    apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it
                    flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune. The advent
                    of the Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional
                    detailed observations from afar.

                    Like the gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn), Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with
                    traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but contains a higher proportion of ices such as water, ammonia and
                    methane. Similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed of ices and rock;[19] both planets are normally
                    considered "ice giants" to distinguish them.[20] Along with Rayleigh scattering, traces of methane in the outermost
                    regions in part account for the planet's blue appearance.[21] Newest data from the Gemini observatory shows the blue
                    colour is more saturated than the one present on Uranus due to thinner haze of Neptune's more active
                    atmosphere.
