                    Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant
                    with an average radius of about nine and a half times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the average density
                    of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive.

                <p class="info-par">
                    Saturn's interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
                    intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally, a gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow
                    hue due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the metallic hydrogen layer is thought
                    to give rise to Saturn's planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth's, but which has a magnetic moment 580
                    times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around one-twentieth of
                    Jupiter's.[29] The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear.
                    Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 kilometres per hour (1,100 miles per hour).

                    The planet has a prominent ring system, which is composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris
                    and dust. At least 146 moons are known to orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; this does not include
                    the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is
                    larger (while less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial
                    atmosphere.
