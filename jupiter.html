                    Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than
                    two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, and slightly less than one
                    one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the
                    Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after Jupiter, the chief deity of ancient
                    Roman religion.

                    Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen (90% by volume), followed by helium, which constitutes a quarter of its mass
                    and a tenth of its volume. The ongoing contraction of Jupiter's interior generates more heat than the planet receives
                    from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation rate of 1 rotation per 10 hours, the planet's shape is an oblate spheroid:
                    it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer atmosphere is divided into a series of latitudinal
                    bands, with turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. The most obvious result of this is the Great Red
                    Spot, a giant storm which has been observed since 1831 and possibly earlier.

                    Jupiter is surrounded by a faint planetary ring system and has a powerful magnetosphere, the largest contiguous
                    structure in the Solar System after the heliosphere. Jupiter forms a system of 95 known moons and probably many more,
                    including the four large moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. Ganymede, the
                    largest of the four, is larger than the planet Mercury. Callisto is the second largest; Io and Europa are approximately
                    the size of Earth's Moon.
